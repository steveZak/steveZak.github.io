</p>

<p>I am a graduate CS student at Georgia Tech.
<br>I work with various Machine Learning applications, including optimal control for autonomous driving, Computer Vision for robotics and recommender algorithms.
<br>Before MSCS I spent 4 years studying Aerospace Engineering here at Georgia Tech,
<br>where I worked primarily with control algorithms and collaborated on a vision-based autonomous driving project.
<br>Check it out here <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11898">Perceptual Attention-based Predictive Control</a></p>

<p>I am interested in ML applications for services designed for the end user.

<p>Currently I am heading the vision team on the Wheelchair Tennis Robot at Georgia Tech's<br> CORE Robotics lab. We are building a robot that can autonomously play tennis!</p>

<p>I also recently started working on project Go-los aiming to solve a complex CV-NLP problem of mute video lip-reading. Check it out <a href="https://github.com/steveZak/go-los">here</a>.</p>

Over the past 2 years I also learned Go to swiftly create and deploy distributed cloud-based microservices. Currently I am studying to get the Associate Cloud Engineer certificate from Google Cloud Platform.
<br>I built a full-stack app that focuses on travel personalization, check it out at <a href="https://pyxy.io">pyxy.io</a>!
<br>It is a React Native app with the backend written in Go served with Docker + Kubernetes.</p>
