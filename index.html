<p>Graduate Student

</p>

<p>I am a graduate CS student at Georgia Tech.
<br>I work with various Machine Learning applications, including optimal control for autonomous driving, CV processing and recommendation algorithms.
<br>Before MSCS I spent 4 years studying Aerospace Engineering here at Georgia Tech,
<br>where I worked primarily with control algorithms and collaborated on a Computer Vision autonomous driving project.
<br>Check it out here <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11898">Perceptual Attention-based Predictive Control</a>!</p>

<p>In the past 2 years I have been interested in applications of ML in services designed for the end user.
<br>I learned Go to swiftly create and deploy distributed cloud-based microservices.
<br>I built a full-stack app that focuses on travel personalization, check it out at <a href="https://pyxy.io">pyxy.io</a>!
<br>It is a React Native app with the backend written in Go served with Docker + Kubernetes.</p>

<p>Recently I started working on project Go-los aiming to solve a complex CV-NLP problem of mute video lip-reading. Check it out <a href="https://github.com/steveZak/go-los">here</a>>.</p>

<p>I am also currently working with a team exploring applications of the DAgger algorithm to develop
<br>autonomous driving algorithms robust to changes in vehicle and environment dynamics. We plan to
<br>introduce LfD and compare its performance to pure RL approaches.</p>
